## About the Collection
Mission Statement:
The Digitization Knowledge Base is a Digital Library that aims to provide a comprehensive and accessible repository of resources and information pertaining to the digitization process. Its mission is to facilitate the preservation, accessibility, and dissemination of cultural heritage materials, scholarly works, and educational resources through digital means. By leveraging technology and adhering to best practices in digitization, we seek to empower researchers, educators, and the public to explore, engage with, and contribute to our digital collection. It is through these efforts that this digital library shall act as a means for users to learn about the tools, methods, and standards employed during the digitization process.

## Collection Policy:
Scope: The collection of the Digitization Knowledge Base encompasses materials related to the digitization process, including but not limited to:
   - Guidelines and standards for digitization
   - Case studies and best practices
   - Tools and technologies for digitization
   - Research articles and publications on digitization methodologies
   - Educational resources for digitization training
Materials included in the collection are selected based on their relevance, authority, and suitability for supporting the goals of the digital library. Priority is given to resources that align with established digitization standards and practices, contribute to the advancement of digitization scholarship, and address the needs of our target audience.

## Acquisition: 
The digital library acquires materials through various means, including academic institutions, open access repositories, and digitization projects. Materials may be acquired in digital format or digitized from physical sources. The materials within this digital library have not been acquired through partnerships or licensing agreements, as such, if any materials are found to violate copyright laws or infringe on the rights of creator, please contact the libraryâ€™s administrator with a request for removal.

## Collection Development: 
Suggestions for new acquisitions or enhancements to existing materials are welcome from users. The digital library aims to review and update its collection to ensure its relevance and currency, however, updates are not guaranteed and may not be implemented quickly, if at all. 

## Enhancement, Evaluation, and Maintenance Plan: 
While I, Natasha Torres, may not be able to personally undertake the upkeep of this digital library beyond the scope of this project due to my impending graduation, I am committed to ensuring its longevity and usefulness. Upon completion, I intend to transfer the rights and responsibilities of maintaining this digital library to Dr. Yan Liu, who has graciously supported this project so that he may oversee its continued enhancement, evaluation, and maintenance. This transfer of ownership will ensure that the library remains a valuable resource for future students and educators.
