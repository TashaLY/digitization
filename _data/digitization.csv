This study examined the concepts and aspects of digitization; digital preservation; digital resources; and access to, use of, and challenges posed by electronic theses and dissertations (ETDs) in university libraries in six geopolitical zones of Nigeria. It adopted a documentary research approach to highlight a critical examination of the various aspects of digitization (to provide electronic information services) as practiced by various university libraries and some library schools in Nigeria. Print theses and dissertations (T/Ds) are digitized by document scanning or direct text input (alphanumeric characters) into computer systems. Digital resources include e-books, e-journals, ETDs, and other forms of documents in electronic formats. ETDs are preserved through digitization, archiving, and creation of websites and databases as well as through floating institutional digital repositories (IDRs). ETD access is facilitated by tools such as automated library catalogs and classification schemes, online public access catalog, indexes, abstracts, bibliographies, and mobile devices such as smartphones and personal computers. ETDs are capable of meeting research and publication needs of teaching, information service delivery, and knowledge sharing. Challenges to digital preservation, access, and use of ETDs include inadequate information and communications technology (ICT) facilities, low ICT proficiency, and erratic power supply. Thus, this study recommended that management teams of universities in Nigeria commit adequate funding to procure ICT facilities, thus providing automatic standby generating plants and increasing incentives for library and digital preservation staff. Collaboration among stakeholders such as university libraries and the National Library of Nigeria should be encouraged to create a national union catalog of T/Ds in Nigerian universities and thus enable a platform for a national database. Access to IDRs will further strengthen worldwide university networking. This study will thus add value to the existing studies on ICT application in university libraries and e-resources in university libraries in Nigeria.","Abubakar Saka, Katamba; Yusufu, Abu; and Mommoh, Rose L.",2021,The Journal of Electronic Theses and Dissertations,scholarly article,,Nigeria,https://doi.org/10.52407/WBNW2510,"Educational use includes non-commercial use of text and images in materials for teaching and research purposes.

Due to information explosion and overload of information, libraries are unable to procure or subscribe to the enormous published information. Libraries are finding it difficult to supply the most deemed reading materials such as reference, rare, career advancement, scholarly publications, government publications, and research related reading materials. Thus, to overcome this existing problem, now the libraries, especially university libraries are starting to digitize the value added reading materials and have made them available through a digital library, gateways, portals, archives, repositories, and consortium electronic platforms. In this context, the present study evaluates the awareness and utilization of digitized resources by users, i.e., postgraduate students, research scholars and faculty members of selected university libraries in Karnataka. A structured questionnaire was framed as a part of doctoral research and 346 questionnaires were distributed among users of selected university libraries that are providing digitized resources through various digital platforms. Further, the study examines the issues of frequent use of digitized resources, preferred document formats to view digital contents, preferred search terms to search and retrieve information and also assesses problems faced by the respondents while accessing ‘Digitized Resources’.",K N Lakshmipathi,2021,Library Philosophy and Practice (e-journal),scholarly article,Senhilkumar R.,"Nebraska, United States",https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/libphilprac/6747/?utm_source=digitalcommons.unl.edu%2Flibphilprac%2F6747&utm_medium=PDF&utm_campaign=PDFCoverPages,"Educational use includes non-commercial use of text and images in materials for teaching and research purposes.

Libraries, archives, museums, and other memory institutions digitize items to preserve fragile materials and create more access points for patrons. The traditional role of the library as simply a place of storage and preservation of books and other information materials which has changed overwhelmingly since the advent of information and communication technologies (ICTs) Academic libraries are duly bound to acquire, preserve and disseminate information from whatever source, hence there is the need for such sources of information to be kept preserved and made available in a more convenient and accessible format. This calls for digitization which is the process of converting analog (print, carvings, artifacts and so on) materials to digital/electronic format. Digitization of information resources in Nigerian University libraries is still at nascent stage. Digitization projects in academic libraries in Nigeria are confronted by a number of challenges. These are essentially not peculiar to academic libraries in developing countries and Nigeria in particular in the efforts of libraries to contribute data to the global information resource base. First and foremost is inadequate funding. Funding for the purchase and maintenance of modern and state-of–the–art digital equipment remains a major constraint while others follow. There is the need for external funds to be injected into the learning base for digitization. The challenge of funding unearths the need for capacity-building in the area of grant-writing and sourcing for fund. Also, there is the need of digitization project equipment and collaboration between libraries and donor agencies to procure these equipment, train staff and organize seminars, workshops and conferences on digitization sensitization network. It can therefore be recommended that Nigerian government and other stakeholders should make education of her citizen a famous priority which boils down to library as an arm of education. The leaders should also be checked on the issue of corruption in other to ensure that the assigned fund for digitization projects are faithfully used to letter.",Peter Olubunmi Olubiyo ,2022,Library Philosophy and Practice (e-journal),scholarly article,"Nancy E.

Questioning the archival imperative of access, this research article discussed how descriptive metadata can be used to contextualize and problematize digitized archival photographs, which are often inadequately described in the digital environment. Beginning with literature review of atrocity photos and their use and digitization to discuss the risks inherent to disseminating photos of or born from violence. Review continued into the digital environment and the risks inherent to making difficult archival collections accessible online and the conflict between the right to privacy of the individuals represented in archival materials and the archival imperative to provide access.

Expanding on the recommendations made for ethical digitization of difficult or problematic archival collections made by scholars and groups such as Tara Robertson, the Archives for Black Lives in Philadelphia Anti-Racist Description Working Group. This article provided Case studies of a variety of digitized archival collections with offensive or violent contents and called for an acknowledgment of archival Labor in deciding which collections should be digitized and for a consensus on how to determine which collections need extra care and consideration in description.

This article criticized the way archival metadata schema and vocabulary reduce photographs to their visual content and provided case studies focusing on metadata. It also introduced contextualizing essays as a tool for critical description. and acknowledged that Metadata work should be used with other measures to ethically digitize and disseminate collections with violent or oppressive histories. It connected Saidiya Hartman’s concept of Critical fabulation to the contextualizing essay, concluding that metadata can be a tool for helping a user of a collection consider it in its historical and social context and provide a space for representing the experiences of those depicted in a collection, especially a collection with violent or problematic origins.",Claudia A.

coll068,item68,"Digitization, digital libraries, access, metadata, academic study",Academic Library Book Digitization and Contemplative Reading ,pdf,"Abstract
Since the beginning of this century, academic libraries have been at the forefront of book digitization and access. During this same period, many individuals have made the transition from reading printed materials to reading on screens. This change in reading habits has led to profound shifts in how libraries conceive their mission, how they structure their spaces, how they organize their resources, and where they allocate funds in their budgets. These changes have been reflected in the Library and Information Science literature, which now includes a rich corpus of research on the impact of digitization on librarians and library services. This article seeks to add to these discussions by exploring the literature on how e-resources impact reading habits, and specifically how these resources orient readers to approach texts with a mindset of efficiency rather than contemplation. After exploring this research, I will offer suggestions for how academic librarians can leverage the unique qualities of the physical book to encourage contemplative reading.",Robin Phillips,2023,The Christian Librarian,scholarly article,,"Oklahoma, United States",https://digital.sandiego.edu/symposium/2024/2024/7/,"Educational use includes non-commercial use of text and images in materials for teaching and research purposes.

",Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago Circulars: A Case Study Early Career Librarian’s Approach to a Full-Scale Digitization Project ,pdf,"Abstract
Each Federal Reserve Bank distributes circulars to their member banks which contain information regarding bank supervision and regulation, services, policies, and district relations. The early circulars of a Reserve Bank, those issued after the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 and before the general regulation of the twelve Reserve Banks through the Banking Act of 1935, illuminate the idiosyncratic nature of the policies and procedures of each district.

In the summer of 2023, the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago sent their circulars from the years 1914 to 1979 to the Digital History and Archives team at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis to be digitized and uploaded to FRASER, the Federal Reserve System’s digital library of U.S. economic, financial, and banking history. The digitization of these archival materials would facilitate access of important historical and contextual information relating to the operations of the Chicago Fed, most notably the bank’s efforts to garner trust in the American people after the banking panics in the early 20th century, and during the World Wars.

This session is a case study of an early career librarian’s approach to a full-scale digitization project, including approaches to project management, hybrid work, and metadata creation. This digitization project also served as an in-depth orientation to the history of the Federal Reserve System and its Reserve Banks in the context of broader American history, in addition to the digitization processes and standards of FRASER.",Delaney McCoy ,2024,Digital Initiatives Symposium,scholarly article,,United States,,"Educational use includes non-commercial use of text and images in materials for teaching and research purposes.

coll070,item70,"digitization, provenance, digital preservation",Documentary Provenance and Digitized Collections: Concepts and Problems,pdf,"Abstract
Provenance research in digitized memory institution collections is mainly devoted to documenting and mapping the trajectories of the physical source documents across time, place and contexts, primarily by developing metadata standards and data models. The provenance of the digital reproduction and its relation to one or several physical source documents is however not being subjected to much inquiry. A possible explanation for this is the face-value approach with which we tend to regard digital reproductions. Looking more closely at such reproductions and their complex digitization process suggests a far from straightforward and linear provenance relation, and begs the question of what it is we actually see on the screen and what source document the digital reproduction purports to reproduce. To ascertain this provenance bond and hence the value, authenticity and usability of the digital reproduction, users need to be provided with keys such as a thorough account of the digitization process, access to various states of the digital images, exhaustive metadata for the reproduction, and not least paradata documenting the digitization process, including conversion, editing, curation, and decisions made during the process.","Mats Dahlström, Joacim Hansson",2019, Proceedings from the Document Academy,scholarly article,,"Ohio, United States",DOI: https://doi.org/10.35492/docam/6/1/8,"Educational use includes non-commercial use of text and images in materials for teaching and research purposes.

coll071,item71,"digitization, born digital, research article","Paratext – a Useful Concept for the Analysis of Digital
Documents? ",pdf,"Abstract
In his study, Paratexts: Thresholds of Interpretation , the French literature scholar Gérard Genette introduces the concept of the “paratext” to the public. Genette explains the term paratext as that “what enables a text to become a book and to be offered as such to its readers and, more generally, to the public” (Genette 1997, 1).

Genette’s concept has since also been applied to other media, especially audiovisual forms, such as film and television. Film scholars are using the concept when analyzing the importance of opening scenes and credits in films , or the significance of different technologies in providing the viewer with extra material about the film. Other media scholars have applied the concept to computer games and gaming , electronic literature and digitized narratives.

The process of digitization, both the digitization of former analogue media like printed books and celluloid film and digital born material, raises new questions, especially in relation to the document’s materiality. Birke & Christ argue “that as long as a text […] is available in the form of a distinct physical object like the CD-ROM and is, as such, limited in its expanse, the concept of paratext can be applied productively”, while the concept “loses its analytic value at the moment when, on the World Wide Web, context […] moves so close to the text” that paratextual elements become “difficult to isolate and identify” (2013, 80). This paper takes this argument as its point of departure to discuss the paratextual elements of different digital documents, showing that the complexity of documents not necessarily is an argument against Genette’s concept.",Roswitha Skare ,2019,Proceedings from the Document Academy:,scholarly article,,"Ohio, United States",DOI: https://doi.org/10.35492/docam/6/1/12,"Educational use includes non-commercial use of text and images in materials for teaching and research purposes.

With the rise of digitizing archival collections across academic and public libraries, more librarians are getting involved in project management, but not all of them have expertise or relevant background in digitization or managing projects. In this 60-minute webinar, you’ll gain tips and strategies for managing digitization projects.


This 60-min webinar is designed to help professionals relatively new to digitization and project management as it outlines some similarities and key differences between managing in-house digitization projects vs outsourcing large-scale digitization projects. Digital project management and digitization expert Marina Georgieva compares and contrasts some important project components such as technology selection, forming and training a team, developing an efficient workflow, and establishing working relations with vendors from three different perspectives: smaller scale projects, larger scale projects and outsourced projects. Georgieva shares her recent experience, explores some challenges related to these types of projects, and covers ways to overcome them. She also provides advice for how to keep all of your projects successful regardless of potential technological or workflow hiccups.

This is a practical workshop based on the presenter’s experience and backed up with real examples from an institution with large-scale digitization capacity and multiple successfully completed grant-funded and internally funded digitization projects.",Marina Georgieva ,2019,Presentation at LITA ,presentation,,United States,https://digitalscholarship.unlv.edu/libfacpresentation/192/,"Educational use includes non-commercial use of text and images in materials for teaching and research purposes.

This doctoral dissertation aims to explore digitization practices at academic libraries in the United States. It examines adopted digitization guidelines, levels of compliance with these guidelines, challenges, and solutions. It seeks answers to five research questions in relation to academic libraries’ compliance with static and non-static (audiovisual) media digitization guidelines, encountered challenges, and applied solutions. A mixed methods explanatory research design was adopted for this comparative study. Purposive sampling was applied. The study sample consisted of 68 subjects from doctoral universities with highest and higher research activity based on the 2015 classification issued by The Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education. Quantitative and qualitative data were gathered through three collection methods: document analysis, electronic questionnaire, and semi-structured interviews. Document analysis was conducted for five sets of digitization guidelines (i.e., ALCTS, BCR’s CDP Digital Imaging Best Practices Working Group, CARLI, FADGI, and NARA), wherein one (i.e., CARLI) consisted of five documents. Open coding was applied to explore themes in qualitative data collected by the electronic questionnaire and semi-structured interviews. The Wilcoxon Signed Ranks Test was applied to examine differences between digitization of static and non-static (audiovisual) media regarding challenges, levels of compliance, availability, and usefulness. The Paired Samples Test was applied only for sets of quantitative data that have normal distribution. Findings revealed differences in the adoption of digitization guidelines for digitizing static and non-static (audiovisual) media. Consistency, Standardization, and Sustainability was the most frequent type of reason for compliance with digitization guidelines adopted for static and non-static (audiovisual) media. Planning and Workflow was the most frequent type of reason for not complying with digitization guidelines adopted for static media, whereas Hardware was the most frequent type of reason for not complying with digitization guidelines for non-static (audiovisual) media. Statistical analyses revealed no significant differences in levels of compliance, availability, and usefulness between static and non-static (audiovisual) media among ALCTS, consortium/consortia, and a university’s own customized digitization guidelines. Open coding indicated that Funding and Hardware challenges appeared among the three most frequent types of challenges for static and non-static (audiovisual) media. The Wilcoxon Signed Ranks Tests revealed significant differences (with the exception of external funding) between digitization of static and non-static (audiovisual) media in terms of budget, digitization equipment/hardware, digitization software, staff digitization skills, and the need for more professional training. Different types of applied and suggested solutions were explored, wherein Planning and Workflow and Funding solutions were most frequent among the applied and suggested solutions for static and non-static (audiovisual) media. The theoretical implications of this study focus on digitization guidelines and compliance levels with those guidelines, and digitization challenges. Practical implications aim to provide suggestions to enhance development of digitization guidelines, and to reduce the effect of challenges faced in digitizing static and non-static (audiovisual) media.",Maali Alghnimi,2018,Theses and Dissertations,theses,,United States,https://dc.uwm.edu/etd/1969/,"Educational use includes non-commercial use of text and images in materials for teaching and research purposes.

The purpose of the paper is to examine the nexus between digitization, preservation and access in the context of selection of archival materials for digitization in Nigeria. In this paper, the author reviewed literature on the importance of archival materials, connection between digitization, preservation and access and the selection of materials for digitization at the National Archives of Nigeria. The study was carried out to understand the phenomenon in a local context and this anchored upon a previous study and preliminary observation by the researcher which revealed that the materials at the National Archives of Nigeria are fast deteriorating and the organization does not have a digitization plan or policy. A digitization policy which clearly outlines the criteria for selection of materials is very important to the digitization plan of any organization. The research adopted a qualitative research method. Data for the study was collected through data analysis and observation. The data collected were triangulated.

The study highlights the importance of selection in the process of digitizing the collections of the National Archives of Nigeria. The paper will be useful to policy makers and all stakeholders as well as the Federal Government of Nigeria. While there are enormous benefits to be derived from digitizing archival holdings, the lack of a selection policy is one of the major challenges faced in the digitization process.
